# WMS-alioos-one
Link to youtube channel where i put updates how it's works : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeqI8fFeu3YWQ6K2wfOirQ
Is a WMS that uses python and the flask framework to display the system on a website. The main idea is for the system to have nested packaging capability, to add as many packages as you want to each package. The system will use to scan products, packages, camera locations from a cell phone and will be connected to a label printer. The database for the system is in MySQL Currently, the system consists of several moduless such as : 
Zostaw (Putaway) -> Produkt (put away product)
Zostaw (Putaway) -> Opak.zbiorcze (putaway packaging)
Weź (Pick) -> produkt (pick product)
Weź (Pick) -> opak.zbiorcze (pick packaging)
Wyświetl (Display) -> produkt (display product)
Wyświetl (Display) -> opak.zbiorcze (display packaging)
Wyświetl (Display) -> miejsce (display space)
Przesuń (Move) -> produkt (move product)
Przesuń (Move) -> opak.zbiorcze (move packaging)
Dodaj (Add) -> produkt (add product)
Dodaj (Add) -> opak.zbiorcze (add packaging)
Dodaj (Add) -> miejsce (add space)
Usuń (Remove) -> produkt (remove product)
Usuń (Remove) -> opak.zbiorcze (remove packaging)
Usuń (Remove) -> miejsce (remove space)
Ustawienia (Settings)

Currently, I am not focusing on the appearance of the site, but its functionality, whether all notifications display correctly and whether the logic is correct.
