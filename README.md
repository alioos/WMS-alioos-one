# WMS-alioos-one
Is a WMS that uses python and the flask framework to display the system on a website. The main idea is for the system to have nested packaging capability, to add as many packages as you want to each package. The system will use to scan products, packages, camera locations from a cell phone and will be connected to a label printer. The database for the system is in MySQL Currently, the system consists of several moduless such as : 
Put away -> put away product
Put away -> leave packaging
Pick -> pick product
Pick -> pick packaging
Display -> display product
Display -> display packaging
Display -> display space
Move -> move product
Move -> move packaging
Add -> add product
Add -> add packaging
Add -> add space
Remove -> remove product
Remove -> remove packaging
Remove -> remove space
Settings

Currently, I am not focusing on the appearance of the site, but its functionality, whether all notifications display correctly and whether the logic is correct.
